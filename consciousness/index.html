    <h1>Consciousness</h1>
    <p>How do you know you're alive? I'm not going to make you stare at your left hand and question the existence of whether or not reality is an illusion but ask yourself: <i>How do you know you're alive?</i></p>
    <p>A fair and simple answer would be that you know you're alive because you can think, which follows from Descartes' famous "Cognito, ergo sum" (or "I think, therefore I am" when translated). But, <i>how</i> do you think? If I were to take your body and amputate your right leg [properly and surgically], would you still be able to think? I'd say so. Now what if I amputate your other leg? Your arms? Your torso? Everything but your head? Well, you still have your brain so <i>surely</i> you should still be able to think, right?</p>
    <p>Well having a whole brain isn't a requirement either because <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/strange-but-true-when-half-brain-better-than-whole/">people can live well with half of one</a>. So, where do we <i>think</i>? If you were to start taking parts of your brain in and out, at what point would you no longer be able to <b>think?</b></p>
    <p>On the principle of taking parts in and out, what happens to one's thinking when you apply Theseus' paradox to their brain? Suppose, with you sitting or standing as you are, I take one the cells in your brain, and replace it with a copy. For just one cell, the entire neural network in your brain would remain intact you'd still be you but, what if I manage to perform this replacement for all of them?</p>
    <!-- The rabbit hole of "are you conscious", "what makes you conscious", and everything we wouldn't expect to be "conscious" -->
    <!-- You saw how your idea of "conscious" dissolved and came back just like that? It's something we all expect to have a hold of, yet we know close to nothing about it. It's like pulsating in terms of viability -->
    <!-- If something so real and so necessary can't be understood, is there _anything_ that we can say we understand? Well, hold your horses, there are things we do understand and have studies the heck out of. Imagine a room and a bright red ball suspended in the air by your hand. When you let go of the ball, many things happen. Firstly, gravity takes hold of the ball and applies a force on the ball going downward, we can determine this value of acceleration given your distance from the center of the earth. Additionally, air comes into play and acts as a fluid, giving resistance to the ball as it continues its decent. Next thing you know all these formulas start to click into place and tell us more and more about this bright red ball until it lands SMACK on the floor only to bounce upward and be determined by more formulas and values now that impulse comes into play. Needless to say from this scenery, we know an awful lot about the ball wherever it may be in the air and we know an awful lot about how it will be one or ten seconds from now. -->
    <!-- Now look at yourself. You as you sit in a chair or stand in a grass field or wherever you may be right now. Let's pause for a moment, you're envisioning yourself in the space you're really in. How awesome is that?! It's you but it it's you while it isn't you since it's really you just considering you. And, inside that you is another you repeating the same loop over and over and over toward infinite (or however far you want to mentally perceive/compute it) -->
    <!-- Granted, the visuals may be self defeating or too frivolous to provide any proper value but now ask this, by straying away from the thoughts about your thoughts/consciousness, are you losing touch in how your mind could be happier? Imagine if we knew as much about our consciousness as we did about the bright red ball! -->

    <!-- TODO continue that ^ line from 'what if we knew as much about...' -->

    <!-- Just like you stretch and warm up before playing a sport as to keep your body in optimal tone and so your body doesn't ache afterwards, wouldn't it be viable to be more in touch with your conscious performance and emotion? -->
    <!-- Aiming to hack your mental state toward maximum happiness or productivity can lead down a rabbit hole of personal strategies and healthy practices but what if we didn't just optimize our general mood? What if we could understand more of the mechanics of how our consciousness works? When you present a specific set of symptoms or have certain physical ailments, your doctor can determine the precise conditions that affect you and then prescribe the proper medication to bring you back into a better state. Or, if you to want to stay up for a few hours to crank out more productive work, you drink caffeine. If you have some mild pains, you have Ibuprofen. For most physical states, it is solveable to derive what to take in a certain moment. Suppose you have a specific mental state you want to attain? Something for math work. Something to generate mental associations more easily for studying a new topic. Something to induce quickly generate empathy among people when they become new roommates in college? -->
    <!-- While some things are known (ie MDMA assisted couples therapy), they come as gross simplifications for the neurological impact that these changes create. As a further long term goal, suppose we can just prescribe ideal medications or signals that will correct your conscious state toward something you want. Even better, what if we could coordinate among larger groups of people ie unity or group flow or conflict resolution? -->
    <!-- Why does this outvalue some of the other pressing problems we have at hand? Well, simply, our conscious experience is what matters. You don't pay for a more expensive meal at a fancy restaurant because it'll lessen your hunger more, you do so for the experience. People gather social validation because the experience of feeling validated is a special one. Much of what we do can be traced to the sheer experience of it (admittedly, I'm a bit biased toward an experience-based perspective but hopefully you see the importance of it as well). If we could make the world happier with where they are, we'll inadvertently solve all of our problems. Also since most of our struggles come from social forces which are determined by and change values, which are interpretations of experiences and experiences themselves. -->
