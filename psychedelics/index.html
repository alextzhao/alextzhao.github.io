    <h1>Psychedelics</h1>
    <p>Just 50 years ago, at the height of the counterculture and hippie movement, psychedelics went from being a miracle for humanity to being a taboo topic that's only dabbled with among druggies. While much legal and social pressure has kept it contained that way for decades, we are now at a point in history where that mindset needs to change.</p>
    <p>Looking at what is happening today, we can see that real change and growth is already taking place. Cities including <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/05/730061916/oakland-city-council-effectively-decriminalizes-psychedelic-mushrooms">Oakland</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/08/us/denver-magic-mushrooms-approved-trnd/index.html">Denver</a> have voted and successfully decriminalized psilocybin mushrooms. Larger initiatives targeting the state level are taking place such as with <a href="https://decrimca.org/">California</a>. On top of all that, it's even going beyond just the people to members of <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1139181400534466560">congress</a>!</p>
    <p>Outside of the scope of general social trend (which, admittedly, can swing in a various direction in a snap), there is legitimate and exciting research happening right now that will only further the trend toward the decriminalization as well as legalization of psychedelic substances. As something that's already gone through the review of research and become legalized, a lesser known dissociative ketamine was <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/121379/download">approved by the FDA</a> earlier this year in a nasal spray for treating depression. MAPS, a non-profit organization focused on the research and education of psychedelics, is entering their <a href="https://maps.org/research/mdma">Phase 3 trials</a> with MDMA assisted psychotherapy for patients with PTSD and working on studies involving <a href="https://maps.org/research/psilo-lsd">LSD as well as Psilocybin</a>. However, this is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to psychedelic substances being considered for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5001686/">clinical applications</a> or even as tools for tackling conditions <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5584001/">like cluster headaches</a>.</p>
    <p>Within just the next 10 years, we can expect more increments of progress and even successful legalization for more of these substances rather than just local votes or decriminalization. With this considered and the social enthusiasm we have so far, it's clear to see that this movement will only grow in the future and that we need to start considering what a world with these will look like. Already, it is estimated that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3917651/">quite a few people</a> have engaged in some psychedelic activity and that number can only be expected to grow when it becomes more accessible. However, psychedelics are very strong substances; taking a tab of LSD is a vastly different degree of experience than drinking a can of beer. Just like you would want to educate people about driving under the influence and controlling their alcohol intake before they turn 21, we should inform people of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_and_setting">set and setting</a> before they do their first 'trip' or <a href="https://michaelpollan.com/psychedelics-risk-today/">serious mental consequences</a> may incur. And this, is why we need to start bringing up the conversation and studying the subject more.</p>
    <p>Shifting toward a more rational perspective - while it is easy (and desirable) to just evaluate psychedelics as universal tools that will solve many of our harder problems (ie PTSD), we still need to recognize that they are illegal substances with a great amount of unknown to them.</p>
    <p>Regarding their legality, it's important to note that the context in which the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Substances_Act">Controlled Substances Act</a> had been set into place was driven by very different social forces than the ones we have today. Throughout the 1960s, the hippies were a proponent of the counterculture movement and a part of the greater anti-war demonstration that targeted the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War. At the time, it posed a considerable threat to the government because they were in the middle of the Cold War which they couldn't back down from without threatening their national reputation. As means of silencing this conspicuous faction, as <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2016/04/legalize-it-all/">one of Nixon's top officials admitted</a>, they put these substances under Schedule One. Given our contemporary context, we would take ahold of psychedelics to study them and append them to our repetoire of tools and drugs to aid people for individual conditions.</p>
    <p>Nonetheless, there is still a good deal that we don't know when it comes to psychedelics. While we could play the safe game and remain distant from the things we don't know about, much of our discoveries come as a result of taking something that was previously unknown and then finding out as much about it as we can. Sure, there will be benefits and detriments stemming from its usage but that can be said about any substance. The reason this is a different case is that it may, as previously expressed, help us tackle some of the problems that were previously unattainable to us.</p>
    <p>The only way we'll have a full comprehension of psychedelics and what they can be used for is through research and awareness. Seeing what is to come, the future is truly exciting and something we should delve into more.</p>
